\section{Conclusion}

Whilst complete state controllability for LTI systems has long been characterised, namely by Kalman's criterion, which states that such a system is controllable (that is, any state can be controlled to any other one in finite time) if and only if the controllability matrix has full row rank, we studied the hardness of deciding controllability for a given pair of states. In particular, if the set of controls is rich enough (finite union of convex polytopes), we showed that this problem is undecidable by encoding Hilbert's Tenth Problem. Even when the set of controls is a convex polytope, we proved Skolem-hardness (actually, we proved Positivity-hardness, which is even stronger). The problem becomes decidable when the set of controls is a linear subspace, by reduction to the (continuous) Orbit Problem.

It would be quite interesting to try to prove undecidability even when the set of controls is a convex polytope, or alternatively show a Turing reduction to a more famous open problem.
