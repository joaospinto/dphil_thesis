\section{Conclusion}

We have shown that the Polytope Escape Problem for continuous-time
linear dynamical systems is decidable, and in fact, polynomial-time
reducible to the decision problem for the existential theory of real
closed fields.  Given an instance of the problem $(f,\mathcal{P})$,
with $f$ an affine map, our decision procedure involves analysing the real
eigenstructure of the linear operator
$g(\myvector{x}):=f(\myvector{x})-f(\myvector{0})$. In fact, we
showed that all complex eigenvalues could essentially be ignored for
the purposes of deciding this problem.

Interestingly, the seemingly closely related question of whether a
given single trajectory of a linear dynamical system remains trapped
within a given polytope, on the other hand, appears to be
considerably more challenging and is not known to be decidable. In
that instance, it seems that the influence of the complex
eigenstructure cannot simply be discarded.
