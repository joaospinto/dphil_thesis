\subsection{Algebraic Number Theory}

In this subsection, we introduce the main concepts in Algebraic Number Theory necessary to understanding the hypothesis for the $S$-units theorem, stated below. In a later subsection, we shall justify the application of the aforementioned result in lower-bounding the dominant terms of linear recurrence sequences. We also briefly explain how one can effectively manipulate algebraic numbers. Should the reader be seeking an in-depth course in computational algebraic number theory, they can consult~\cite{Cohen}.

A complex number $\alpha$ is said to be \emph{algebraic} if it is the root of some non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients. Among those polynomials, there exists a unique one of minimal degree whose coefficients have no common factor, and it is said to be the \emph{defining polynomial} of $\alpha$, denoted by $p_{\alpha}$, and it is always an irreducible polynomial. Moreover, if $p_{\alpha}$ is monic, $\alpha$ is said to be an \emph{algebraic integer}. The degree of an algebraic number is defined as the degree of $p_{\alpha}$, and its height as the maximum absolute value of the coefficients of $p_{\alpha}$ (also said to be the height of that polynomial). The roots of $p_{\alpha}$ are said to be the \emph{Galois conjugates} of $\alpha$. Note that the complex conjugate of $\alpha$ is always a Galois conjugate of $\alpha$.
We denote the set of algebraic numbers by $\Algebraics$, and the set of algebraic integers by $\mathcal{O}$. For all $\alpha \in \Algebraics$, there exists some $n\in\Naturals$ such that $n \alpha \in \mathcal{O}$. It is well known that $\Algebraics$ is a field and that $\mathcal{O}$ is a ring. A complex number that is not algebraic is said to be \emph{transcendental}.

A \emph{number field} of dimension $d$ is a field extension $K$ of $\Rationals$ whose degree as a vector-space over $\Rationals$ is $d$. In particular, $K\subseteq\Algebraics$ must hold.
Recall that, in that case, there are exactly $d$ monomorphisms $\sigma_{i} : K \rightarrow \Complex$ whose restriction over $\Rationals$ is the identity (and therefore these must map elements of $K$ to their Galois conjugates).
Given an algebraic number $\alpha$, $\Rationals(\alpha)$ denotes the smallest number field containing $\alpha$. Moreover, if $K=\Rationals(\alpha)$, then $\alpha$ is said to be a \emph{primitive element} of $K$. It is well known that all number fields have a primitive element.

The \emph{ring of integers} $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of a number field $K$ is the set of elements of $K$ that are algebraic integers, that is, $\mathcal{O}=K\cap\mathcal{O}$.
An ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is an additive subgroup of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ that is closed under multiplication by any element of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$. An ideal $\mathfrak{P}$ is said to be prime if $ab\in \mathfrak{P}$ implies $a\in\mathfrak{P}$ or $b\in\mathfrak{P}$. The following theorem is central in Algebraic Number Theory, and a proof can be found in~\cite{SnT}:

\begin{theorem}
In any ring of integers, ideals can be uniquely factored as products of prime ideals up to permutation.
\end{theorem}

The next theorem, by Evertse, van der Poorten, and Schlickewei, was established in~\cite{Evertse84,PS82} to analyse the growth of linear recurrence sequences. It gives us a very strong lower bound on the magnitude of sums of $S$-units, as defined below. Its key ingredient is Schlickewei's $p$-adic generalisation~\cite{Sch77} of Schmidt's Subspace theorem.

Let $S$ be a finite set of prime ideals of the ring of integers
$\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of a number field $K$. We say that
$\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ is an \emph{$S$-unit} if all the ideals
appearing in the prime factorisation of $(\alpha)$, that is, the ideal generated by $\alpha$, are in $S$.

\begin{theorem}[$S$-units]
\label{thm:s-units}
Let $K$ be a number field, $s$ be a positive integer, and $S$ be a
finite set of prime ideals of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Then for every
$\varepsilon>0$ there exists a constant $C$, depending only on $s$,
$K$, $S$, and $\varepsilon$, with the following property. For every
set of $S$-units $x_1,\ldots,x_s\in\mathcal{O}$ such that
$\sum\limits_{i\in I} x_i\neq 0$ for all non-empty $I\subseteq\lbrace
1,\ldots,s\rbrace$, it holds that
\[ \lvert x_1+\cdots+x_s \rvert\geq CYZ^{-\varepsilon} \]
where $Y=\max\lbrace \lvert x_j\rvert : 1\leq j\leq s \rbrace$ and $Z=\max\lbrace \sigma_i(x_j): 1\leq j\leq s,1\leq i\leq d \rbrace$ and $\sigma_i$ represent the different monomorphisms from $K$ to $\Complex$.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Manipulating algebraic numbers}
\label{sec:alg_num_rep}

The following separation bound allows us to effectively represent an arbitrary algebraic number by keeping its defining polynomial, a sufficiently accurate estimate for the root we want to store, and an upper bound on the error. We call this its \emph{standard/canonical representation}.

\begin{lemma}[Mignotte]
Let $f\in\Integers[x]$. Then
\begin{equation}
f(\alpha_1)=0=f(\alpha_2)\Rightarrow \lvert \alpha_1-\alpha_2\rvert>\frac{\sqrt{6}}{d^{(d+1)/2}H^{d-1}}
\end{equation}
where $d$ and $H$ are respectively the degree and height of $f$.
\end{lemma}

It is well known that arithmetic operations and equality testing on these numbers can be done in polynomial time on the size of the canonical representations of the relevant numbers, since one can:
\begin{itemize}
\item compute polynomially many bits of the roots of any polynomial $p\in\Rationals[x]$ in polynomial time, due to the work of Pan in~\cite{Pan97}
\item find the defining polynomial of an algebraic number by factoring the polynomial in its description in polynomial time using the LLL algorithm~\cite{LenstraLenstraLovasz1982}
\item use the sub-resultant algorithm (see Algorithm 3.3.7 in~\cite{Coh93}) and the two aforementioned procedures to compute canonical representations of sums, differences, multiplications, and divisions of canonically represented algebraic numbers
\end{itemize}

Moreover, we need to know how to decide whether a given canonically represented algebraic number $\alpha$ is a root of unity, that is, whether $\alpha^r=1$ for some $r$. If that is the case, then its defining polynomial will be the $r$-th cyclotomic polynomial, which has degree $\phi(r)$, if $r$ is taken to be minimal, that is, if $\alpha$ is a primitive $r$-th root of unity. The following (crude) lower bound on $\phi(r)$ allows us to decide this in polynomial time, assuming that the degree of $\alpha$ is given in unary.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\phi$ be Euler's totient function. Then $\phi(r)\geq\sqrt(r/2)$. Therefore, if $\alpha$ has degree $n$ and is a $r$-th root of unity, then $r\leq 2n^2$.
\end{lemma}

Therefore, in order to decide whether an algebraic number $\alpha$ of degree $n$ is a root of unity, we check whether it is a $r$-th root of unity, for each $r\leq 2n^2$. In order to test whether $\alpha$ is a $r$-th root of unity, it suffices to see whether $\gcd(p_\alpha,x^r-1)=p_\alpha$, since we know that $x^r-1$ is the product of each $d$-th cyclotomic polynomial, with $d$ ranging over the divisors of $n$.

\subsubsection{Lattices}

Consider a non-zero matrix $K\in\Algebraics^{r\times d}$ and vector $\myvector{k} \in \Algebraics^r$.  The following proposition shows how to compute a representation of the affine lattice $\{ \myvector{x} \in \Integers^{d} : K\myvector{x} = \myvector{k} \}$. Further information about lattices can be found in~\cite{LatticeBook} and~\cite{Cohen}.

\begin{proposition}
There exist $\myvector{x}_{0} \in \Integers^{d}$ and
$M \in \Integers^{d \times s}$, where $s < r$, such that
\begin{align*}
  \{ \myvector{x}\in\Integers^{d} : K\myvector{x} =
  \myvector{k} \} =
  \myvector{x}_{0} + \{ M \myvector{y} : \myvector{y} \in \Integers^s \} \, .
\end{align*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\theta$ denote a primitive element of the number field
  generated by the entries of $K$ and $\myvector{k}$. Let the degree of this extension, which equals the degree of $\theta$, be $D$. Then for $\myvector{x} \in \Integers^{d}$ one can write
\begin{align*}
K \myvector{x} = \myvector{k} &\Leftrightarrow \left( \sum \limits_{i=0}^{D-1} N_{i} \theta^{i} \right) \myvector{x} = \sum \limits_{i=0}^{D-1} \myvector{k}_{i} \theta^{i} \\
&\Leftrightarrow N_{i} \myvector{x} = \myvector{k}_{i}, \forall i \in \lbrace 0, \ldots, D-1 \rbrace ,
\end{align*}
for some integer matrices $N_{0}, \ldots, N_{D-1} \in \Integers^{r \times d}$ and integer
vectors $\myvector{k}_{0}, \ldots, \myvector{k}_{D-1} \in \Integers^{r}$.
The solution of each of these equations is clearly an affine lattice, and therefore so is their intersection.
\end{proof}
