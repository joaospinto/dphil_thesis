First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisors: Professors Ben Worrell, Jo\"{e}l Ouaknine, and Elias Koutsoupias. I could not have hoped for better supervision during the past three years. This thesis would not exist without their guidance and encouragement.

I am also very grateful to all the wonderful people I have met whilst at Oxford. In particular, I would like to thank Andrew, Aris, Clara, Diogo, Edo, Francesco, Francisco, Gon\c{c}alo, Hosein, Hossam, Jasper, Jorge, Luis, Mafalda, Marcelo, Marina, Mathura, Miguel, Nicolas, Nikola, Ninad, Pascal, Philippos, Rajdeep, Raphael, Rita, Sebouh, Shahab, Smriti, Sophia, Stephen, Straulino, Tom\'{a}s, and Ventsi. Their friendship is invaluable.

Moreover, I would like to thank St Cross College for the diverse and stimulating environment it promotes within its community, which were of great value to me. I will always remember college lunch very fondly.

It was an honour to have been examined by Professors Alessandro Abate (Confirmation of Status and Viva), Paul Goldberg (Transfer of Status), Angus MacIntyre (Confirmation of Status), Jonathan Pila (Transfer of Status), and Jeffrey Shallit (Viva).

Finally, I am obliged to acknowledge that, without the generous funding of the European Research Council (ALGAME grant) and of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, I would have been unable to conduct the research that led to this thesis.
