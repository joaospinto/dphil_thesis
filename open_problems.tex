%Are ENT and W equal? Is ENT semi-algebraic? What about NT? Can we solve this problem in general? Can we characterise NT (apart from membership testing, which is equal to the positivity problem)?

%Generalised Continuous Orbit/Skolem when matrices commute

% membership problems in 3x3
%reachability with continuous piecewise affine 1-d function
